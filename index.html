                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                    My life started when I was born at the very young age of zero. This event most likely occurred in a hospital on Earth, however I cannot confirm this as I have no memory of the event. I was raised in a multicultural Australian household mostly composed of various other humans, one dog, and a guinea pig, and currently I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in information technology at RMIT University.

                    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                    <h3>My interest</h3>
                    <p>
                    The modern day is frequently described as an age of information overload. (Hemp, 2009) I believe such a description overlooks the advantages gained by having a perspective shaped by experience in multiple fields of knowledge, unimpeded by monetary or physical barriers. My primary interest in IT is in the ability to create tools to navigate and distil this information overload into something more useful.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My experience</h3>
                    <p>
                    My first serious experience with IT was when I was quite young, with an open source program that taught C++ via a series of exercises for guiding an ant out of a labyrinth. Interested in doing more, I spent a lot of time using free sites such as Khan Academy to learn more about programming and its real world applications. Wherever I could include IT in my schoolwork, I did so, e.g. using sensor data gathered with an Arduino in addition to my own observations. When I finished school, I decided to pursue my interest seriously and look for related career options.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
                    <p>
                    RMIT is a QS 5-Star rated university and ranked as the 18th best university in the world that is less than fifty years old. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, RMIT has allowed students to study entirely online. The university makes use of its industry connections to offer students hands-on experience, ensuring that they gain the practical skills they need for work. (RMIT University, 2022)
                    </p>
                    <h3>My expectations</h3>
                    <p>
                    I expect to gain from RMIT a detailed understanding of the field of information technology, how its many facets function, how they are used in our world, and how I would function as an IT professional.

                    <h3>What does the job entail?</h3>
                    <p>
                    A technical writer uses their knowledge of multiple fields to enable communication between audiences with radically different backgrounds. This allows businesses to sell products to a wider userbase, as a properly documented product does not need prior knowledge to use it, and lets specialists in fields such as marketing and programming work together smoothly. The challenge of figuring out how things work and explaining them in terms accessible to anyone is what I find personally appealing.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>What skills, qualifications, and experience are needed for the job?</h3>
                    <p>
                    This specific position requires the ability to work with tools such as Confluence, JIRA, ADO, Git/Github, HTML, CSS, and Beamer. Previous experience in a SaaS (Software as a Service) technical writing role and in developing end-to-end documentation is necessary, as are tertiary level qualifications in technical writing or a related line of work. Applicants need full working rights in Australia and be able to obtain a working with children check. (SEEK - Technical Writer Job in Sydney, 2022)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, most important to the position is the ability to communicate professionally and effectively with multiple different audiences, such as the IT world, the business world, and the consumer world. This multidisciplinary approach is necessary as a person in this role is expected to take into account the needs and feedback of other professionals such as product managers, marketers, and engineers in order to create and preserve useful documentation, devise standards and strategies to facilitate teamwork, as well as contribute to future product releases and advertising using their insights into the customer base. These insights are gained from gathering customer feedback, and recording data on the usage of training materials. To make documentation more accessible to customers, a technical writer should have the ability to produce non-standard documentation such as videos as well as traditional wiki-based documentation. (SEEK - Technical Writer Job in Sydney, 2022)
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>My skills, qualifications, and experience</h3>
                    <p>
                    Currently my skills include web development, Github, Mediawiki, and presentation design, as well as video production and editing. As a self-directed and proactive learner I rapidly gain proficiency with new tools, and would not have problems learning to use the preferred software for this position. My experience is mainly from personal projects, and I am in the process of gaining tertiary level education in a field relevant to this position.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>My plan</h3>
                    <p>
                    The main obstacle to getting such a position is my lack of experience and certified education. To gain acceptable professional experience, I will participate in volunteer work to document FOSS projects. As for certified education, I am in the progress of obtaining a bachelor’s degree in information technology.

                    <h2>IT Project</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                    Heartbeat is an app that tracks heartrate data provided by wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbits, and intelligently compares it to location data in order to infer a user’s sense of safety in their current environment. After this data has been checked for validity, it is added to an anonymised aggregate map of data from all users who have opted into having their data publicly shared. This map allows users to identify “fear hotspots,” places where many other users had a noticeably elevated heartrate despite not physically exerting themselves. This aggregate map can then be analysed by third parties in order to identify why certain places are inducing the physiological indicators of a fight-or-flight response.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Why is this useful?</h3>
                    <p>
                    When developing a website, UX developers work with data scientists to run surveys on a site’s userbase to optimise user retention and experience. Thousands of users are exposed to subtly different interfaces in order to find the one that works best. (Grant, 2022)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It is very hard to conduct such surveys for physical architecture. Presenting different versions of a building to enough users for the data gathered to be meaningful would require expensive renovations every time a new version was to be presented to the public. Such renovations would also put the building out of service for a prolonged time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    One useful aspect of Heartbeat is it's ability to allow data analysts to notice when an aspect of a building is causing users noticeable discomfort, without significant expense on the part of the analyst’s employer or irritating users with intrusive surveys. Once an issue has been identified, justifying the investment of resources into resolving that issue is much easier.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <p>
                    Heartbeat’s initial release will be downloadable from the Google Play store for Android phones. As many of its capabilities can be considered invasive, most will be turned off by default. Upon downloading the app, the user will be shown an optional settings walkthrough that allows the user how to customise their experience and turn on the more invasive features if they wish to use them. However, the user will be given an obvious option to skip this and set a minimally invasive default.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It will use bluetooth to sync with a wearable fitness monitor such as a Fitbit, and GPS to plot a user’s location over time on a map. Using this location data, it will determine whether a user is exerting themselves by running, or if they have an abnormally fast heartbeat that is not caused by exercising, e.g. caused by fear. The app will attempt to filter out garbage data caused by GPS malfunctions or users travelling by car with the app turned on, by only using data that falls inside sensible ranges and comparing it against accelerometer data from the phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Users may opt into having their data regularly anonymised and added to a publicly visible aggregate heatmap, allowing all users to view what locations are regularly identified as causing people fear. The initial release of heartbeat will likely mistakenly identify gyms as places of fear, as users will be exerting themselves but not travelling at sufficient speed for the app to register this as normal exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Later versions of the app will offer users more non-core features, such as the option to choose to be notified whenever they enter a location that has been identified as a fear hotspot, via audio notification, vibration, or push notification, as well as route plotting to avoid such places, and notifications of when the user themselves is personally experiencing fear or abnormal heart activity, which may be helpful for those who have heart conditions or disorders such as PTSD or anxiety. Other later features that will be included are a one-tap option to anonymously notify a business owner that their business is or is located in a fear hotspot. This notification will allow business owners to use Heartbeat’s data to guide improvements to their business, or permanently turn off such notifications if they are not interested in receiving them.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Tools required</h3>
                    <p>
                    The initial alpha release will be for Android smartphones, as this is the easier OS to create a proof of concept for. As such, development will require the Android Studio IDE, which can be downloaded for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. For initial testing of the app, a smartphone running a reasonably recent version of Android OS is necessary, as well as a wearable fitness monitor capable of Bluetooth. Expanding the supported platforms to include the Apple iOS would require a Macintosh computer, either physical or virtual, and the Xcode IDE.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skills required</h3>
                    <p>
                    To create the first draft of the app, learning to effectively use the Android Studio IDE and the Kotlin programming language is necessary. Studying graphic design, UX design, professional writing, and product testing is critically important for creating an app that is appealing to users rather than repulsive and difficult to use. For the core functions that make the app unique, an understanding of data analytics is needed. Data analytics is used to collect data from users, filter out garbage data and plot valid data on the public map. There should be no issues with obtaining the hardware or software for development, as they are either ubiquitous in modern society or otherwise are well supported by common platforms.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                    Successfully developing and launching Heartbeat will have many positive benefits, such as allowing people to be better informed when making decisions when travelling or moving homes, and alerting local governments and businesses as to when change needs to be made to improve the safety and experiences of their dependents or customers, e.g. dealing with criminal activity or other hazards to their welfare.
